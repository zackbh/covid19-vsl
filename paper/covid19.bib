	abstract = {It is urgent to understand the future of severe
                  acute respiratory syndrome{\textendash}coronavirus 2
                  (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. We used estimates of
                  seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for
                  betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series
                  data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2
                  transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime
                  outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after
                  the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other
                  interventions, a key metric for the success of
                  social distancing is whether critical care
                  capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or
                  intermittent social distancing may be necessary into
                  2022. Additional interventions, including expanded
                  critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic,
                  would improve the success of intermittent distancing
                  and hasten the acquisition of herd
                  immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are
                  urgently needed to determine the extent and duration
                  of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of
                  apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should
                  be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could
                  be possible as late as 2024.},
